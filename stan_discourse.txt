Suggestions:- Bob: scalable method: not applicable here because if I understood well what you said, they are currently unable to give uncertainty interval (right)- ruarai: I tried different priors but didn’t remove the issue with treedepth, although adapting prior of lengthscale make sense and is something I will keep in mind for other variants of this model (this model is already a simplified version, so that’s why I’m picky and want to fully understand how it works before extending it). I also tried differentThe user is seeking ways to increase the speed and efficiency of a reduced-rank Gaussian process (GP) model for monthly birth data in Switzerland, noting that 50 basis functions are needed for stable sampling. The model uses a Gaussian process to model time-varying peak age in a negative binomial regression, with the GP implemented via a practical Hilbert-space approximation (HSGP). The issue arises from high R-hat values and max tree depth warnings when using fewer basis functions. Bob_Carpenter suggests seeking input from experts like @avehtari and @andrewgelman, and mentions scalable spectral methods for GPs. ruarai suggests tighter priors on the GP lengthscale to avoid low values that require more basis functions. avehtari notes that 400s for 10,800 observations is reasonable and suggests an additive model with periodic and smooth components to reduce the number of basis functions, while also recommending a partial non-centered parameterization for HSGP. Niko shares a blog post on HSGP reparameterization for improved performance.
